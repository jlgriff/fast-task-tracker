# Introduction

This is a single-page frontend ReactJS application to quickly save, complete, sort, and delete tasks in a matter of seconds.

Most to-do-list applications require the user to create an account and sign-in before recording anything. Sometimes though, recording a task _needs to happen right now_.

Fast-task-tracker allows users to instantaneously record a to-do the second it comes to them. No logins, no backend calls, no database queries, nada. Instead, it saves tasks directly to the browser's local storage, like a temporary note but with full to-do-list functionality.
